I'm a Machine Learning Research Engineer at Eedi, specializing in building practical ML solutions that bridge cutting-edge research and real-world applications. With 7+ years of experience spanning autonomous driving, wearable AI, and education technology, I focus on developing efficient, deployable models that solve complex problems.

My research has been recognized with a Best Paper award at ECCV-2024 Smart Eyewear Workshop and cited 450+ times, with open-source contributions achieving 400+ GitHub stars. My work has been demonstrated at major industry events including AWE-USA and CES.

I'm a UK Global Talent awardee and hold a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Waterloo and a Master's from the University of Tokyo. I speak English, Bengali and Hindi fluently, with N2 certification in Japanese proficiency.

**Current Focus**

At Eedi, I develop models that improve personalized learning at scale. My work combines educational and generative AI with practical MLOps to deliver measurable impact for students and educators.

**Research Interests**

- **Event-Based Vision & Wearables:** Pioneered ultra-low power gesture recognition systems for always-on smart eyewear, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy at only 6mW power consumption.
- **Autonomous Driving:** Developed learning approaches for motion forecasting and 3D object detection, enabling robust perception in complex urban environments.
- **Efficient ML:** Specializing in building high-performance models with practical constraints: low power, limited data, real-time deployment. My ML work has been shipped in production for AI music tutor applications.

**Technical Expertise**

Deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras), MLOps platforms (AWS, Azure, MLFlow, ClearML), 3D computer vision, self-supervised learning, graph neural networks, and event-based vision.
