    - title: Machine Learning Engineer
      institution: Eedi, London, UK
      year: 2025 - Present
      description:
        - I develop ML and Gen-AI solutions to power the next generation of intelligent education technology.
        - Co-authored research introducing new uncertainty-based approach that identifies struggling students where traditional metrics fail, enabling EdTech platforms to intervene at critical moments.
        - Improved ML pipeline maintainability and scalability by refactoring 4 Knowledge Tracing (KT) models to reduce code by 31% and decrease new model implementation from 300+ to 50 lines.
        - Presented a session on Generative AI for Education and LearnLM to share knowledge across the team. 
    
    - title: Senior Machine Learning Engineer
      institution: Ultraleap, Bristol, UK
      year: 2023 - 2025
      description:
        - Led ML development of real-time hand tracking foundation models for the future of AI music tutors. Re-designed Ultraleap's core model architecture within 3 months to improve temporal modeling, occlusion robustness and 3D spatial accuracy. This improved finger-to-piano-key alignment and addressed critical user experience challenges.
        - Built fine tuning and LoRA models to tune Ultraleap's core foundation hand tracking model on piano performance data for AI Music Tutor applications.
        - Tech-led ML development of mobile-optimized architectures for ultra-low-power gesture control in smart glasses. Model accuracy improved by 20% (F1>80%) with 25x reduction in power consumption. Demonstrated model at CES-2025, publicly launched as part of a development kit, and technical pre-print is under review.
        - Pioneered low-power low-latency ML models, representations and custom loss functions enabling micro-gesture detection for Meta-Raybans. Rapidly delivered a prototype within 6 months, publicly demonstrated at AWE-USA-2024 and featured by CNET. Won Best Paper award at ECCV-2024 Smart Eyewear Workshop.
        - Implemented and tested mobile-friendly custom convolutional (EfficientNet, MobileNet, ConvNext) and vision transformer-based feature extractors to improve hand-tracking performance on edge devices.
        - Researched and planned advanced dataset curation work for large-scale training data from cutting-edge ML research papers. Resolved critical pose-class imbalances addressing key customer pain-points and boosting IR pinch-tracking accuracy by 50%+.
